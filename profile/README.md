## Welcome to the team page of the ATCA QUOCKA Survey!

### Whatâ€™s in a name?
The QUOCKA Survey is named for the [quokka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quokka), which is not only a cute Australian animal often seen in selfies, but is also uniquely found in the area near Perth where the core of the QUOCKA team is based.

### About QUOCKA
The main aim of the QUOCKA project is to provide new understanding about the properties of polarized radio galaxies in the distant Universe. Among other things, this will help us to interpret results from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder ([ASKAP](https://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/askap/index.html)). To learn more about the science that QUOCKA will enable, please see our [Science](Science) page.

The Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) is a powerful platform for pioneering discoveries in the area of radio polarimetry. In addition to being a well-maintained and -understood telescope, it is unique in providing a very broad frequency coverage. The QUOCKA project studies radio galaxies across the 1-8.5 GHz range, which is essential to uncover their detailed structure.

We invite you to explore the QUOCKA survey here, and to [contact us](https://research.csiro.au/quocka/contact/) for further information.
